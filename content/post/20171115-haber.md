#### Description

In this talk we will explore deep neural networks from a dynamical systems point
of view. We will show that the learning problem can be cast as a path planning
problem with PDE constraint. This opens the door to conventional Computational
techniques that can speed up the learning process and avoid some of the local
minima.
